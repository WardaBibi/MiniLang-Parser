# MiniLang-Parser
## MiniLang Parser

This repository contains a simple parser for the MiniLang programming language implemented in Python. The MiniLang parser includes a scanner for tokenization and a parser for parsing MiniLang programs.

### Usage

To use the MiniLang parser, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd MiniLang-Parser
```

3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

4. Run the parser script with the MiniLang code file as an argument:

```
python parser.py <file_path>
```

Replace `<file_path>` with the path to your MiniLang code file.

### Example

Suppose you have a MiniLang code file named `example.minilang`. To parse this file, run the following command:

```
python parser.py example.minilang
```
